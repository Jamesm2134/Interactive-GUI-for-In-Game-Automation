## Overview
After playing Minecraft for many years, I often needed to install an auto clicker whenever I built AFK farms. So, I thought, why not make one myself?
##
SimpleClicker is a straightforward GUI application for automating mouse clicks in Minecraft. It offers three modes: Auto Clicker, Auto Clicker Moving, and AFK Attacking. The application is built using Python with Tkinter and customtkinter libraries, and it utilizes pyautogui for simulating mouse actions and keyboard for handling input.

**PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER BUG FIXING**
